             Climate change is undoubtedly one of the leading existential threats we face today. Combatting this threat and improving our understanding of the environments around us, thousands of scientists actively study Earth’s climate to inspire solutions. Beginning in the summer of 2023, I interned as a research assistant at USC’s Climate Dynamics Lab. My primary task was to produce a model that analyzes the net warming trends (heating anomalies) in Earth's atmosphere from the last few thousand years through the 22nd century.

              In 2015, the U.N. introduced 17 sustainable development goals, or <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SDGs</a>, to strategically focus on healthier economic development by 2030. Inspired by this (specifically SDG 13), my peers and I wanted to see if we could predict air quality patterns in hopes of discovering solutions. Starting from scratch, I designed a deep-learning model to predict the future presence of particulate matter in our atmosphere. I calculated all of the tensor and convolution dimensions firstly by hand and then proceeded to implement it using PyTorch. The model was trained off of time series data, to learn more and view the code, click <a href="https://github.com/omswack/aersol-CNN-LSTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

           MusicaHub is a full-stack web development project that allows users to stay up to date on the "global" listening experience. Powered by Spotify's REST API, the platform is constantly updated on any recent changes to the playlist(s) located in Spotify. The songs page features a dynamic loading UI. The platform utilizes SQL to manage user states, metadata, and so on for a heightened experience. Through the different user states such as admin, regular, and guest, the project effectively provides CRUD functionality.

      I am a recent graduate from the University of Southern California (Fight On!) where I hold a dual degree in 1.) Data Science and 2.) International Relations and the Global Economy. I am currently seeking career opportunities in data science and adjacent fields where I can improve my technical abilities and be a leader. Aside from my current career interest, as my degrees suggest I am curious individual and enjoy studying different subjects including (not exclusively) macroeconomics and finance, global policy and affairs, philosophy, history (currently Early Renaissance) and mathematics. In my free time, I enjoy weightlifting, swimming, reading, backpacking, learning guitar, and watching the Chicago Cubs beat the White Sox.
